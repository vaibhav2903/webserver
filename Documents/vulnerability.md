#Vulnerability

#SQL Injection

#Description

The web server can be compromised using a SQL Injection attack. This aids the attacker to run SQL commands on the database server which is utlized by web application server. 

##Steps to Reproduce

1. Open the exposed page(https://web-server-url.com/signin) on the web server.
2. In the username credentials field, enter the following SQL injection payload, such as `' OR '1'='1`.
3. Enter any value in the password field.
4. Click the "Sign in " button.

##Mitigation

To handle this issue, following best practices can help in avoiding such issues:
1. Use parameterized queries and prepared statements to separate data.
2. Make sure that the data used is valid and remove unwanted spaces to prevent malicious payload. 
3. The users who have more privileges should be limited accordingly.
4. Another shield which could be used is by using a Application Firewall to filter malicious requests.



##Cross-site scripting

We can compromise the web server with cross-site scripting. This allows the attacker to run JS code from user's browser context. 

##Steps to Reproduce

1. Go to the main page(https://web-server-url.com/leave_feedback) which is  
2. In the text section, write the following JS script <script>alert('XSS')</script>.
3. Now, send the text written.
Now, since the page is vulnerable to XSS, it will show an alert box with XSS when the text is shown on the page.

##Mitigation

Following best practices can help in navigating such issues in web server applications.
1. Validate user input for malicious purposes.
2. Encode the content
3. Implement CSP headers
4. Use a web application firewall to filter out malicious requests.
